            <h2>Balochi Culture</h2>
            <p>
                Balochi culture is deeply rooted in strong tribal traditions, a legendary 
                code of honor, and immense hospitality. It is visually famous for its 
                distinctive clothing: men wear wide, flowing shalwar kameez and turbans, 
                while women wear vibrant, loose-fitting dresses adorned with intricate, 
                colorful Balochi embroidery ('Doch').

            <h2>Land & Minerals</h2>
            <p>
                Pakistan's largest province by area, a vast and rugged 
                land defined by arid mountains, extensive deserts, and 
                a long coastline on the Arabian Sea. This landscape holds 
                immense mineral wealth, including one of the world's largest 
                deposits of copper and gold (at Reko Diq) and Pakistan's most 
                significant reserves of natural gas, coal, and chromite.

            <h2>History of Ziarat</h2>
            <p>
                Ziarat is a famous hill station near Quetta,
                renowned for housing the Quaid-e-Azam Residency, 
                the historic wooden building where Muhammad Ali Jinnah 
                spent his final days. The town is also celebrated for its 
                ancient, slow-growing juniper forests, which are among the 
                oldest and largest in the world.
