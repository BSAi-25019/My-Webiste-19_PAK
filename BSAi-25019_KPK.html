            <h2>The KHANS & their History </h2>
            <p>
                In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), "Khan" is a title of great respect, historically
                 used for Pashtun tribal chiefs, leaders, and influential landowners. Originating 
                 from a Turco-Mongolic word for "ruler," the title was adopted by Pashtun society 
                 to denote nobility and leadership. While it once signified a person's high status, 
                 "Khan" is now also one of the most common surnames in the region, carried by descendants
                  of these prominent families.

            <h2>Khyber Pass</h2>
            <p>
                The Khyber Pass is a legendary mountain pass in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
                 Pakistan, connecting the city of Peshawar to Afghanistan. For millennia,
                  it served as a vital part of the ancient Silk Road and, most famously, 
                  as the main gateway for countless invasions into the Indian subcontinent.

            <h2>The Skill on Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                The architecture of KPK is a blend of ancient, regional, 
                and colonial styles, influenced by its geography and history.
                 It includes the ancient Gandhara style with Greco-Buddhist 
                 elements, Islamic and Mughal designs like the Bala Hisar 
                 Fort and Mohabbat Khan Mosque, and colonial structures reflecting 
                 the British influence, such as buildings in Peshawar.
