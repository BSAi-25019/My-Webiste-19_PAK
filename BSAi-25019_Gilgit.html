            <h2>The Hidden & Paradox</h2>
            <p>
                Gilgit is renowned for its thrilling traditional sports, especially Polo, 
                which is famously played in its free-style form, often called the "King of Games."
                 The area is also blessed with stunning natural beauty, most notably the lush 
                 Naltar Valley, which is famous for its vibrant, colorful lakes and as a popular 
                 skiing destination in winter.

            <h2>The Lakes & Peaks</h2>
            <p>
                Gilgit is a gateway to some of the planet's most majestic mountains and 
                stunning alpine lakes. The entire region is a meeting point for the 
                three greatest mountain ranges in the world: the Himalayas, the Karakoram, 
                and the Hindu Kush.

            <h2>The Chershing Border</h2>
            <p>
                The Khunjerab Pass, the big border crossing between Pakistan and China,
                 located way up in the mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan. It's famous because 
                 it's the highest paved border in the world, so high up that the air is thin
                  and it's cold even in summer. That huge gate you see is the official entry
                   point on the Chinese side, and it's a really popular spot for tourists to
                    visit and take pictures.
