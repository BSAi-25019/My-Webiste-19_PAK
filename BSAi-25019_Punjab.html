            <h2>Architectural Marvels</h2>
            <p>
                Punjab, the cultural heart of Pakistan, is home to some of the most 
                remarkable architectural landmarks in the country. From the grandeur 
                of the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore to the intricate carvings of the Shalimar 
                Gardens, Punjab's architectural heritage reflects a blend of Mughal, Sikh, 
                and colonial influences. Historical forts, palaces, and shrines showcase 
                exquisite craftsmanship, with detailed frescoes, ornate arches, and 
                delicate marble inlays. These buildings not only tell the story of Punjab's 
                rich past but also stand as a testament to the region's artistic excellence, 
                attracting scholars, tourists, and art enthusiasts from around the world.
